This parallelism was an idea I mocked up a few months ago but, due to other commitments, didn't get around to putting to code until recently. Different from my more general-purpose freebies, this one's specifically built for portfolio use with a unique look/layout. Hope you enjoy it!

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged:
